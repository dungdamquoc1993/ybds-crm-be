package requests

// Since the current handlers (GetUsers and GetUserByID) don't require any request body validation,
// we don't need any request structs. The handlers only use query parameters and path parameters
// which are parsed directly in the handler functions.

// This file is kept as a placeholder for future request types that might be needed.
